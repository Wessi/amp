/*
 * The GIS Display Engine
 *
 * This module is a bridge between the pure data layer (see ../data/gis-data),
 * and the components which ultimately display that data. Its scope is to
 * manage display-related state.
 *
 * Some examples:
 *  -> Exposing a dynamic generated title for tha map
 *  -> Managing colours used in the display of the data (and legend, etc)
 *
 * The idea is to make the components that display stuff dumb, and centralize
 * all that logic and state here, in hopes that creating new components (which
 * may want access to any kind of existing display state) can be created
 * easily, without having to touch much of the rest of the system.
