### Initial install

Install NodeJS and npm. http://nodejs.org/


Install `gulp` globally:

```bash
$ cd src
$ sudo npm install -g gulp
```

Install all of the package.json dependencies locally. Run this command from inside this folder.

```bash
$ cd src
$ npm install
```


### Updates

Call `npm install` after each pull to make sure latest build plugins are there.

```bash
$ cd src
$ npm install
```

When adding new dev/build dependencies, use the `--save-dev` option for npm so that they are added to [`package.json`](package.json), so that other developers can keep up to date. Make sure to commit the updated `package.json` to version control when you commit.

```bash
$ cd src
$ npm install jshint --save-dev
```


Usage
-----

All commands are automated with [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), and configured in [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js).


### Production builds

Compiled versions for testing and distribution are in `dist/`. 

```bash
$ cd src
$ gulp build
```
