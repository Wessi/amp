              <p>During the 4th EU Summit with Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Vienna, Austria, in May 2006, the Heads of State and of Government took the decision to commence negotiations in relation to a potential Association Agreement between the European Union and countries of Central America. </p>
              <p><br />
              An Association agreement implies the establishment of mutual commitments in three complementary areas: Political dialogue, Cooperation and the establishment of a Free Trade Area between the European Union (EU) and the countries of Central America (CA). </p>
              <p><br />
              The Political Dialogue component aims to establish institutionalised mechanisms which will promote discussions and information exchange in different instances between the EU and CA on bilateral and regional questions of mutual interest.  Such dialogue could allow for the adoption of joint positions on subjects of international importance. Through the various mechanisms all parties will strive to encourage a series of common values endorsed by both regions including among others respect for democratic principles and basic human rights, the protection of the environment and the strengthening of the Rule of Law. </p>
              <p><br />
              Within the context of the Association Agreement, the Cooperation component hopes to go beyond the current financial aid provided by the EU to CA which has already been committed for the period 2007-2013 with the principle aims of promoting social cohesion and regional integration and to identify specific mechanisms whereby both regions can reach identified aims both in the Political Dialogue and Trade components.  It should be noted that the EU is already one of the main providers of development cooperation in Central America. </p>
              <p><br />
              With regard to Trade issues, an Association Agreement would imply the establishment of a Free Trade Area between countries of Central America and the European Union. In the commercial context, Central America has maintained close economic ties with Europe for a long time, ties which have benefited from the EU Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) that permits many of Central American products to enter the EU market without paying customs duties or with the application of highly preferential rates. Despite this, a significant number of goods in which CA has the competitive advantage have been excluded from the GSP initiative, a fact which encouraged countries in the region to advance in the deepening of commercial relations with the EU through adherence to a free trade agreement. </p>
              <p><br />
              Negotiations between the EU and CA take place both in Brussels and in Central American countries on a rotating basis. Currently the VIII Round of Negotiations is under preparation and significant progress is expected. Negotiations are entering their final stages and an Association Agreement should be concluded in early 2010. </p>

                <p>As the first Blue Book on the European Union’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Nicaragua was given a very positive reception, we are happy to present the new, improved 2008 version. As before, the Blue Book details the value and composition of all European Union (EU) development cooperation in Nicaragua, but it has a number of changes which make it even easier to use and more visually pleasing. Many of these improvements were made following helpful feedback from EU donors during preparations for the 2008 update of the Blue Book and its sister tool ODAnic. </p>
                <br /><p>The Blue Book meets a number of EU donor needs including the desire to have greater transparency and visibility for our joint development efforts in Nicaragua. The first version also provided momentum to the EU Working Group responsible for making progress in the implementation of  the EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity and Division of Labour in Development Policy. This is described in greater detail on page 10. </p>
                <br /><p>The Blue Book highlights some of the similarities and differences in development tools, processes and approaches taken by the European Commission (EC) and the 11 Member States (MS) present in the country. One example of this is the availability of up to date project and programme data. For certain EU donors with a more decentralised management approach this data is readily available in-country whereas for other donors such information is often managed by Headquarters and therefore there are substantial time delays in acquiring it. This in itself has presented one of the greatest challenges to compiling comprehensive and accurate data for the 2008 Blue Book during the first quarter of the year as originally foreseen. The statistics contained in the Blue Book are provisional and we therefore strongly encourage readers to visit  the ODAnic web site regularly (see link below) in order to obtain the very latest data made available by EU donors. On a very positive note, we are pleased to announce that this year ODAnic contains additional aid information from non-EU donors, both bilateral and multilateral. <br />
                    <br />
                  During the 3rd High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra, Ghana last September, many donors agreed to support a new International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) which seeks to improve the quality, availability and therefore transparency of aid information. With this in mind, donors have been urged to agree on common standards, format and conduct for aid reporting by 2010. We are fortunate that Development Gateway, the main consultant for the 2008 Nicaragua Blue Book, is helping to guide this process. As a result, our efforts in Nicaragua should have a wider impact, as the experience and lessons from ODAnic help to inform the global aid transparency dialogue.</p>
                <br /><p>We want to thank all those colleagues from the European Commission and Member States who contributed to the 2008 Blue Book and ODAnic update. We also want to thank EU donors in Vietnam who once again provided material for this version. Finally, we are grateful to Development Gateway and Xolo Systems for their innovative recommendations and technical inputs. </p>
                <br /><p>Further copies of this document can be downloaded together with more disaggregated data on EU ODA to Nicaragua by visiting http://nic.odadata.eu/.</p>
                <br /><p>Until next year, </p><br /><br /><br />

              title: 50 Years Building Europe
              introduction: |
                  2007 marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of Treaties of Rome, the founding charter of what has become the European Union.
                  For 50 years, the EU members have enjoyed unprecedented peace, prosperity and stability, and carried their integration to hitherto unseen levels.
              content_left: |
                  <p>
                  On 25th March 1957 , two treaties were signed in Rome that gave birth to the European Economic
                  Community (EEC) and to the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom): the Treaties of
                  Rome. The  Treaty establishing the EEC affirmed in its preamble that signatory States were “determined
                  to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe“. It came into force on 1 January 1958.</p>
                  <p>The new supranational organisation started out as a customs union. As a consequence, the
                  EEC was colloquially known as the “Common Market”. Member countries agreed to dismantle
                  all tariff barriers over a 12-year transitional period and to establish common tariffs for all
                  products coming from third countries. </p>
                  <p>The “Common Market” gradually developed into a Single Market, providing for the free circulation
                  of not only goods, but also services, people and money across national boundaries. The
                  euro has become the common currency for many Europeans. Europeans are more and more
                  acting together also in areas going beyond the economic realm, in external relations, defence
                  and security, justice, environmental protection and many other fields. </p>
                  <p>The Treaties of Rome and the 50 years that followed thus signified the triumph of a very realistic
                  and gradualist approach to building the EU. A process was put in motion in which progressive
                  economic integration was paving the way to a long-term objective: that of a comprehensive
                  union of the countries and peoples of Europe.</p>

                  <p><b>Twelve Historic Steps of the European integration</b></p>
                  <p>1951 The European Coal and Steel Community is established by the six founding members (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands).</p>
                  <p>1957 The Treaty of Rome establishes the European Economic Community (EEC) or common market and the European Atomic Energy Community.</p>
                  <p>1973 The Community expands to nine Member States with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>1979 The first direct elections to the European Parliament.</p>
                  <p>1981 The first Mediterranean enlargement with the accession of Greece.</p>
                  <p>1986 Spain and Portugal enter the EU, bringing membership to 12.</p>
                  <p>1993 The single market and its four freedoms are established: the free movement of goods, services, people and money.</p>
                  <p>1993 The Treaty of Maastricht establishes the European Union. It is a major EU milestone, setting rules for the future single currency, for foreign and security policy and closer cooperation in justice and home affairs.</p>
                  <p>1995 The EU expands to 15 members with the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden.</p>
                  <p>2002 Euro notes and coins are introduced in 12 Member States.</p>
                  <p>2004 Ten more countries join the Union: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia.</p>
                  <p>2007 Bulgaria and Romania join the European Union, brining the number of member states to 27 countries. Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey are also candidates for future membership.</p>

              summary: |
                  The European policy on development has been formally defined in the “European Consensus on Development”. This policy statement, adopted by the Council, the Parliament
                  and the Commission in December 2005, reflects the EU willingness to make a decisive contribution to poverty eradication in the world. It provides the EU with a common vision for development and sets out the policy to guide implementation of this vision at the Community level. To enhance effectiveness for improving overall development results and impact on poverty reduction, the Council adopted in May 2007 the “European Code of Conduct on Complementarity and Division of Labour in Development Policy”. This Code of Conduct presents operational principles for EU donors regarding complementarity in development cooperation and thus aims at reducing transaction costs in partner countries.

              vision: The European Union’s vision of development
              vision_contents_p1: |
                The Declaration sets out common objectives guiding the EU development cooperation activities. The primary objective is the eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable deveopment, inline with the international agenda, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other objectives such as human rights and good governance. </p>
                <p><br />
                EU development cooperation will promote common values and effective multilateralism. These common values include: respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, peace, democracy, good governance, gender equality, the rule of law, solidarity and justice.</p>
                <p><br />
                The EU is committed to a set of common principles of development cooperation which are: ownership and partnership, in-depth political dialogue, participation of civil society, gender equality and a continuous engagement towards preventing state fragility.</p>
                <p><br />
                The EU committed to increase aid budgets to 0.7% of GNI by 2015, with an intermediate target of 0.56% by 2010. </p>
                <p><br />
                The EU will also provide more effective aid through the implementation and monitoring of its commitments on aid effectiveness in all developing countries, including setting concrete targets for 2010. The use of general or sectoral budget support should increase, where circumstances permit. Debt reduction will be issued where necessary and the untying of aid will be further promoted.</p>
                <p><br />
                The EU will further advance in the area of donor coordination, harmonisation and alignment. The EU made four additional commitments to the Paris Declaration: all capacity building assistance is provided through coordinated programmes with an increasing use of multi-donor arrangements; 50% of government-to-government assistance is channelled through country systems, including by increasing the assistance provided through budget support or sector-wide approaches; no new Project Management Units are established; the number of un-coordinated missions is reduced by 50%.</p>
                <p><br />
                The EU will advance policy coherence for development and will ensure that all EU non-development policies which are likely to affect developing countries, such as trade, security and migration will contribute to partner countries’ efforts in achieving the MDGs.</p>

              policy_contents_p1: |
                  Community policy in this field must complement the policies of the Member States. Its added value comes from its global presence and expertise, its role in promoting consistency between policies and best practice, in facilitating coordination and harmonisation, in supporting democracy, human rights, good governance and respect for international law, in promoting participation in civil society and North-South solidarity.
              policy_contents_p2: |
                  The Community will use the most efficient instruments available: it will favour a differentiated approach based on needs, priorities and the strengths of the countries concerned.
                  Development cooperation is a major component of a broader set of external measures which must be consistent and complementary.
              policy_contents_p3: |
                  The Community will concentrate its activities in the following nine areas: trade and regional integration; the environment and the sustainable management of natural resources; infrastructure, communications and transport; water and energy; rural development, territorial planning, agriculture and food security; governance, democracy, human rights and support for economic and institutional reforms; prevention of conflicts and of state fragility; human development; and social cohesion and employment.
              policy_contents_p4: |
                  The Community will strengthen mainstreaming in relation to certain issues involving general principles applicable to any initiative and which call for efforts in several sectors: democracy; good governance; human rights; the rights of children and indigenous peoples; gender equality; environmental sustainability; and the fight against HIV/AIDS.
              policy_contents_p5: |
                  The type of aid provided will be tailored to the needs and context of each individual country. Where conditions allow, budget aid will be the preferred type. The Community will use an approach based on results and performance indicators. Most Community aid will continue to be provided in the form of grants, an approach which is particularly suitable for the poorest countries and for those with a limited ability to repay.
                  <br/>The reform of external aid initiated by the Commission in 2000 has made it possible to improve Community assistance and the quality of the aid provided. Further improvements will be made in areas including information systems and there will be further devolution to the delegations.

                “Complementarity” is defined as the optimal division of labour between various actors so as to achieve optimum use of human and financial resources. It involves co-ordination and specialisation in areas where a donor can add value. Complementarity can be:<br />
                <ul>
                <li>
                in-country by addressing over-representation of donors in certain “attractive” sectors while others – not less important – remain under-funded;
                </li>
                <li>
                cross-country by addressing the widening gap between aid darlings and aid orphans ;
                </li>
                <li>
                cross-sector to make the most out of the know-how and comparative advantage of each EU MS and ensure that key sectors/themes are covered by the EU as a whole;

                <li>
                vertical between initiatives at the national, regional and international level
                cross modality and instrument to find the most appropriate balance between instruments of aid delivery.

                The Code of Conduct is embedded in the principles of ownership, alignment, harmonisation and management for results and mutual accountability of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness as well as the EU commitments set out in the European Consensus on Development. The Code is a dynamic document that establishes principles and targets towards which EU donors strive to work progressively and accordingly on a voluntary, flexible and self-policing basis. It invites any other donors to commit themselves to abiding it and base their activities on similar principles.<br/>
                As the partner country holds the responsibility of coordinating donors, EU donors commit themselves to encourage and support the partner country to assume that responsibility.

                <p><strong>2008 – A Significant Year</strong><br />
                2008 was a busy and highly significant year for donor coordination. In April, the OECD-DAC survey on the monitoring of the Paris indicators in which 22 donors and the Government of Nicaragua participated was released, and in September the 3rd High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness took place in Accra, Ghana.  Ministers of developing and donor countries responsible for promoting development and Heads of multilateral and bilateral development institutions endorsed the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) in an effort to accelerate and deepen implementation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Among others, the AAA places explicit emphasis on the role and importance of all development partners and in particular national and international civil society organisations. As a consequence donors are increasingly pursuing stronger links and more regular dialogue with organized civil society in Nicaragua in order to ensure that the aid effectiveness agenda is inclusive and pertinent.</p>
                <br/><p>Aid coordination remains a highly complex and formidable task given the large number of donors in Nicaragua (reportedly over 40) and the high volume of ODA per annum not to mention the second lowest development indicators in the region and a constantly changing political and economic landscape which present considerable challenges for the success potential of any harmonisation and alignment (H&amp;A) initiative. Nicaragua continues to be a priority country for many EU donors and is highly dependent upon on external cooperation in order to meet its development goals.</p>
                <br/><p>Together with the European Commission there are currently 11 EU Member States with cooperation entities based in Nicaragua (Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom); this combined force is the main net ODA contributor to Nicaragua in terms of donations and therefore any EU-led coordination initiative has the potential to impact substantially on the local aid environment.   EU donors are working closely among themselves, with non-EU donors, with the Government of Nicaragua and with other development partners in order to define strategic priorities and operational plans for H&amp;A in 2009 and beyond. <br />

                <p><strong>Perspectives for Harmonisation and Alignment in 2009 and beyond</strong><br /><br />
                  <strong>Adoption of a New Nicaragua National Action Plan for Harmonisation, Alignment and Ownership  2009-2011</strong><br />
                Together with the Government of Nicaragua, the multi-stakeholder Technical H&amp;A Working Group hopes to develop and adopt an Action Plan for the period 2009-2011 which will place emphasis on the 3 main axes of harmonisation, alignment and country ownership in keeping with the spirit of the Paris Declaration and will include targeted objectives, specific actions, expected results, indicators of achievement and deadlines for completion on a short, medium and long term basis.  The previous plan 2005-2007 underwent a thorough assessment in 2008 and the ensuing recommendations and lessons learned will be fed into the new Action Plan. </p>
                <br /><p><strong>Implementation of the EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity and Division of Labour in Development Policy</strong><br />
                Adopted in May 2007, the EU Code of Conduct (CoC) represents possibly one of the greatest coordination challenges for EU donors in Nicaragua in recent years.  The Code stipulates that where possible EU donors should restrict their presence to a maximum of 3 priority areas, should pay attention to their distribution among sectors and aim to address neglected sectors which are of national importance. In order to define the status quo and identify baseline indicators, EU Donors present in Nicaragua completed a survey on the Guiding Principles in 2008 and subsequently formed a specific Working Group in order to take forward the results.  All EU donors agree on the necessity to define an Action Plan for the Implementation of the CoC in Nicaragua in the coming years if there is to be any change of making progress on this rather complex issue.  It is clear from the outset that there are several obstacles impeding greater progress such as unsynchronised programming, budgeting and disbursement cycles among EU donors. There is a strong need for greater harmonisation of financial regulations and implementing rules among EU donors and clearer orientations and commitment from Headquarters in order to put the Code into practice on the ground.  EU Donors will work to ensure  greater delegated cooperation (i.e. silent partnerships) and, where appropriate, general or sector budget support.</p>
                <br /><p><strong>Optimisation of High-level Dialogue Mechanisms: Global Roundtable and Donor Quintet</strong><br />
                Through active participation in the Global Roundtable, donors will aim to optimise dialogue with Government at both technical and political levels in 2009. The Quintet, a high-level Steering Group created in February 2006 will continue to meet regularly with the Government of Nicaragua in order to discuss national priorities and to present common donor positions.  The Quintet currently comprises Denmark and the European Commission together with non-EU donors - Canada, Japan, the Inter American Development Bank and the World Bank. </p>
                <br /><p><strong>Strengthened Donor Coordination: Sector Roundtables</strong> <br />
                  In Nicaragua sector roundtables were established in 2003 in the priority areas of Education, Governance, Health, Infrastructure, Production, and Social Protection.  EU Donors are present in all these fora and are actively contributing towards the development of Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps). SWAps contain multi-annual action plans and expenditure forecasts allowing government and donors to better plan activities and financial disbursements with a medium to long-term perspective.  Roundtables will continue to promote common platforms through the signature of Codes of Conduct and Memoranda of Understanding in order to improve coordination and better support approved sector strategies and common funding arrangements.</p>
