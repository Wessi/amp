1) What does it do?
   ----------------
    The script searches for the unclosed sessions in a source directory
structure. It will search in all the sub-folders recursively and verify
only the java files.

2) How do I use it?
   ----------------
   First you edit launch.sh and change the path variable to match the 
folder where the scripts are located (you can put them in /bin also).
   
   Then you go to the parent directory where the sources folder is and
run launch.sh (with the whole path if you didn't put in bin) with the
sources folder name as a parameter. It will output the name of the file and
the function name where the problems are located.

3) Who do I credit for this?
   -------------------------
   See the Author section ... btw does anyone read this ? ;))
