  dac_crs_sector: |
      Area(s) of core activity of a project.
      
      As the DAC/CRS Sector codification is the only international standard useable for interagency or inter-donor statistical comparability, it is necessary to use only this type of codification. See Appendix of the DAta Entry or User Manual 
      
      The selection of only one sector is allowed. It is extremely important, that the selection reflects the official DAC/CRS codification used by the member State for reporting to the OECD. Member States should therefore request this information from their Head Quarters in case this information is not available in their Field Office.
      
      The DAC Sector is the 3 digit code such as 111000 Education, 12100 Health General 
      
      Next to the Main 3 digit DAC Sector Code, the DAC CRS Sector is the more specific 5 digit sub-Sector code such as 11110 Education policy and administrative management. See Appendix 
  description: |+

      Goals/objectives: The purpose or goal representing the desired result that a project or programme seeks to achieve. This can be written in a short statement covering the main objectives pursued by the project, or in a list of objectives, described in keywords. Include target groups and number of beneficiaries if the data is available and if it helps to understand the scope of the project. If goals are described by using % figures, make sure that the respective basis (100%) and the time frame are known.
      
      Implementation:
      •	Key activities (main actions to achieve above described goals)
