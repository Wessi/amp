Possible ways to refactor reports:
	- Use namespaced controllers for each report, each having an index and a list action (at least), e.g.
		/reports/donors showing current ReportsController::donor and /reports/donors/1 showing ReportsController::project_list
	- The general report builder should stay abstract
	- A common base class among the reporting controllers could simplify things and make them DRY
	- Possible interface for middleware classes to provide the filtering in each step of the report generation via hooks (SQL generation, postprocessing of the reports table etc.)
