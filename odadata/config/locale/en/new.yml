          <p>ODAmoz 2.0 is the updated version of the original EC funded electronic data base that provides information on Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Mozambique. The original version was created in response to the Paris Declaration advocating for strengthened coordination and harmonization among Donors and alignment with the Government of Mozambique. After 4 years it had  proven necessary to upgrade the technical basis to a more sophisticated model in order to meet the increasing and more complex needs of the government and its development partners. Furthermore the system has been made more user-friendly according to requests and feedback from all users.</p>
          <p>ODAmoz enables to track Donors' and United Nations Agencies' projects and programs in the country: where they are operating, who finances them, and which organization implements them. </p>
          <p>It is a user-friendly database, accessible to all through the internet. Its "Design your own report" function makes it easy to search for specific information through a set of predefined criteria (donor, DAC sector, location, project status, funding type and MDGs) and offers tables and geographic maps (ODAmap) for analysis. </p>
          <p>Welcome to ODAmoz!</p>
      introduction_long: |
          <p><strong>History</strong><br>
          In 2005, the EC Delegation in Mozambique hired a consultant in the context of the EU Pilot Initiative on Coordination & Harmonization in order to establish among other a common EU Project Database DbIS. This database was established, centralizing and making available the information on activities of all EU Member States operating in Mozambique.<br><br>
          In a further step of overall Donor harmonization in Mozambique in the light of the Paris Declaration, it was agreed to open up the EU DbIS to <strong>ALL</strong> Donors present in Mozambique and merge with the UN Project Database to a new common Donor database called ODAmoz.<br><br>
          This initiative was fully endorsed by the Development Partners Group in charge of the simplification and harmonization of development cooperation in the country.<br><br>
          In light of the need to guarantee Government of Mozambique ownership and to ensure a proper administrative set up of the project, management of ODAmoz was handed over to the designated directorate in the Ministry of Planning and Development (MPD): the Direcao Nacional de Investimento e Cooperacao (DIC) in September 2006 and a <strong>ODAmoz Management Committee</strong> installed in late 2006, composed of Donor and GoM representatives.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Objective</strong><br>
          The main objective and focus of ODAmoz is to provide donors with a tool, based on international standards (e.g. OECD/DAC sector codification), to fulfill their obligations towards the Government of Mozambique of reporting and planning on quarterly disbursements (see downloads).<br><br>
          It also gives the GOM, donors and the public in general a snapshot of donors and UN agencies projects and financial commitments.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Update timeline</strong><br>
          As mentioned above, ODAmoz focuses on reports on quarterly disbursement data and forecasts for the current year and annual values for further <strong>3 years according to Medium Term Expenditure Forecast (MTEF) procedure</strong><br><br>

          The ODAmoz Management Committee agreed to link the update procedure to the Official Budget Cycle of GoM. In general the <strong>update deadlines</strong> will be followed according to below mentioned dates:<br>

          1st Quarter:                                         1st of April - 15th of May<br>
          2nd Quarter:                                        1st of July - 15th of August<br>
          3rd Quarter:                                        1st of October - 15th of November<br>
          4th Quarter / Yearly report:                15th of January - 15th of February<br>
          <br>
          <p><strong>UN Reporting Specificity</strong><br>
          Due to UN's specific and heterogenic funding arrangements (working with both core and donor funds) and the difficulty in separating them, <strong> it has been agreed that UN agencies can fully report on their overall funding (core + donor) even if possibly already reported by a donor in ODAmoz.</strong> The respective donor implementing a project via an UN Agency will need to explicitly state this in the concerned Project Nr e.g.: An EC Project Nr: 9ACPMOZ011, implemented via UNDP should be inserted in <strong>ODAmoz</strong> as 9ACPMOZ011/UNDP.<br><br>

          Donor Totals and UN Agency totals therefore should not be added up in order to avoid double counting. In the Search by Donor Report, Donors and UN Agencies already have been separated. It is planned to enable this for each query possibility, probably until October 2010.<br><br>
          Please note that this therefore does not always enable us to have a clear picture of the full combined Donor and UN ODA to Mozambique.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Responsibility</strong><br>
          Each Donor and UN agency has selected a focal point that is responsible for collecting, entering and updating the data online on a quarterly basis. Accuracy and completeness of the data can only be guaranteed up to the last quarterly disbursement; forecasts are based on estimates.<br><br>
          The Ministry of Planning and Development (MPD) and its Directorate for Investment and Cooperation (DIC) is gradually taking up responsibility for the general overview of the database and production of the quarterly reports on Donor disbursements.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>ODAmoz' Vision</strong><br>
          ODAmoz is becoming more and more Donor inclusive, and is seen as a very useful tool, e.g. in the On/Off-Budget discussions with the Government of Mozambique and in providing a common source of information for many of the Donors involved that are revising their country strategies.<br><br>
          The intention is therefore, among other, to train focal points in each sector line ministry at central and provincial level as users in order for the Government of Mozambique to fully exploit ODAmoz's potential.<br><br>
