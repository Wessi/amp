          target groups and number of beneficiaries if the data is available and if it helps to 
          understand the scope of the project. If goals are described by using % figures, make sure

        markers: |
          ODAdata includes following Policy and Rio Conventions Markers as per OECD definition:
          
          Environment Policy Marker: Non applicable, Significant, Principal 
          Gender Policy Marker: Non applicable, Significant, Principal 
          Bio Diversity Marker: Non applicable, Significant, Principal 
          Climate Change Marker: Non applicable, Significant, Principal 
          Desertification: Non applicable, Significant, Principal 
          
          This system of Policy and Rio Convention Markers was introduced by OECD/DAC in 
          order to establish a method to monitor ODA according the different international 
          agreements such as for Environment.

        sectors: |
          Area(s) of core activity of a project. 
          
          As the DAC/CRS Sector codification is the only international standard useable for 
          interagency or inter-donor statistical comparability, it is necessary to use only this type of 
          codification. See Appendix 2  
          
          The selection of only one sector is allowed. It is extremely important, that the selection 
          reflects the official DAC/CRS codification used by the member State for reporting to the 
          OECD. Member States should therefore request this information from their Head 
          Quarters in case this information is not available in their Field Office. 
          
          The DAC Sector is the 3 digit code such as 111000 Education, 12100 Health General
