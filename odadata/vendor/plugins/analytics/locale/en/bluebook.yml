                This is the very first Blue Book on the European Union’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Nicaragua. It represents the culmination on one year’s work and the combined efforts of
                the European Commission and eleven Member States. The Blue Book provides a wealth of information on the value and composition of EU development cooperation in Nicaragua. This is
                significant given that the EU is the main net ODA provider to the country. Outlines of the poverty reduction strategies and priorities for Nicaragua of the EC and each MS can be found in
                the EU Donor Profile section.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                Aid effectiveness is a growing priority for both donors and beneficiaries in the fight against poverty; indeed this Blue Book forms part of a broader EU package aimed at enhancing donor
                coordination, improving complementarity and ultimately achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                Following on from the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the European Consensus on Development was approved and adopted in December 2005. The Consensus provided momentum
                for increased coordination among EU donors through the establishment of a set of common values, principles and objectives for development policy. The subsequent approval of the
                EU Code of Conduct for Development Policy in May of this year is a major step towards practical measures to implement greater complementarity and division of labour at the field level.

                Nicaragua is an OECD/DAC pilot country for making progress on the Paris Declaration Harmonisation and Alignment (H&amp;A) agenda. It is also one of only a handful of countries to have
                developed its own H&amp;A National Action Plan. The first round of monitoring implementation of the Paris Declaration in 2006 highlighted lots of challenges for the Government of Nicaragua
                and donors. The EU is strongly committed to supporting in-country efforts to advance the aid effectiveness agenda.

                Many individuals have worked hard to turn the Blue Book from a concept into a reality. We want to thank all those colleagues from the EC and MS who made valuable contributions. We
                also want to thank EU donors in Vietnam who first pioneered the Blue Book initiative and inspired us to follow their example. Finally, we are grateful to ODAdata and Xolo Systems for their
                technical input.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                Please note that only EU Member States physically present in Nicaragua are participationg. 
                Further, only ODA under responsability of the Agency/Embassy of the EU Member State participating is counted here. 
                Full ODA disbursements for 2007 can be higher.

            introduction: |
                2007 marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of Treaties of Rome, the founding charter of what has become the European Union.
                For 50 years, the EU members have enjoyed unprecedented peace, prosperity and stability, and carried their integration to hitherto unseen levels.
            content_left: |
                <p>
                On 25th March 1957 , two treaties were signed in Rome that gave birth to the European Economic
                Community (EEC) and to the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom): the Treaties of 
                Rome. The  Treaty establishing the EEC affirmed in its preamble that signatory States were “determined
                to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe“. It came into force on 1 January 1958.</p> 
                <p>The new supranational organisation started out as a customs union. As a consequence, the
                EEC was colloquially known as the “Common Market”. Member countries agreed to dismantle 
                all tariff barriers over a 12-year transitional period and to establish common tariffs for all 
                products coming from third countries. </p> 
                <p>The “Common Market” gradually developed into a Single Market, providing for the free circulation
                of not only goods, but also services, people and money across national boundaries. The 
                euro has become the common currency for many Europeans. Europeans are more and more 
                acting together also in areas going beyond the economic realm, in external relations, defence 
                and security, justice, environmental protection and many other fields. </p>
                <p>The Treaties of Rome and the 50 years that followed thus signified the triumph of a very realistic 
                and gradualist approach to building the EU. A process was put in motion in which progressive 
                economic integration was paving the way to a long-term objective: that of a comprehensive 
                union of the countries and peoples of Europe.</p>

                <p><b>Twelve Historic Steps of the European integration</b></p>
                <p>1951 The European Coal and Steel Community is established by the six founding members (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands).</p>
                <p>1957 The Treaty of Rome establishes the European Economic Community (EEC) or common market and the European Atomic Energy Community.</p>
                <p>1973 The Community expands to nine Member States with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>1979 The first direct elections to the European Parliament.</p>
                <p>1981 The first Mediterranean enlargement with the accession of Greece.</p>
                <p>1986 Spain and Portugal enter the EU, bringing membership to 12.</p>
                <p>1993 The single market and its four freedoms are established: the free movement of goods, services, people and money.</p>
                <p>1993 The Treaty of Maastricht establishes the European Union. It is a major EU milestone, setting rules for the future single currency, for foreign and security policy and closer cooperation in justice and home affairs.</p>
                <p>1995 The EU expands to 15 members with the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden.</p>
                <p>2002 Euro notes and coins are introduced in 12 Member States.</p>
                <p>2004 Ten more countries join the Union: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia.</p>
                <p>2007 Bulgaria and Romania join the European Union, brining the number of member states to 27 countries. Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey are also candidates for future membership.</p>

            summary: |
                The EU is the world’s foremost donor of development aid, accounting for 55% of the total. However, the effectiveness of European aid can and must be increased through renewed
                efforts to improve coordination and harmonisation. This Consensus presents a shared vision to guide the European Union’s activities in the field of development cooperation,
                both at Member State and Community level.
            summary2: |
                The European Consensus on Development is a policy statement jointly adopted by the Council
                and the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council,
                the European Commission and the European Parliament on 20 December 2005. For the first
                time in fifty years of cooperation, the Brussels consensus defines the framework of common
                principles within which the EU and its twenty seven Member States will each implement their
                development policies in a spirit of complementarity.
            vision: The European Union’s vision of development
            vision_contents_p1: |
                The declaration sets out the objectives and principles on the basis of which the Member
                States and the Community commit themselves to a shared vision. As the chief objective is
                to reduce poverty worldwide in the context of sustainable development, the EU is seeking
                to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015:
                <br>• to eliminate extreme poverty and hunger;
                <br>• to achieve universal primary education;
                <br>• to promote gender equality and empower women;
                <br>• to reduce child mortality;
                <br>• to improve maternal health;
                <br>• to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases;
                <br>• to ensure environmental sustainability; and
                <br>• to set up a global partnership for development.
            vision_contents_p2: |
                It also takes the view that the fundamental objective of poverty reduction is closely associated
                with the complementary objectives of promotion of good governance and respect
                for human rights, these being shared values underpinning the Union. The fight against
                poverty also implies achieving a balance between activities aimed at human development,
                at the protection of natural resources, and at economic growth and wealth creation
                to benefit poor people.
            vision_contents_p3: |
                The common principles of development cooperation activities are ownership and partnership,
                in-depth political dialogue, participation of civil society, gender equality and an
                ongoing commitment to preventing state fragility. Developing countries bear the primary
                responsibility for their own development, but the EU accepts its share of responsibility and
                accountability for the joint efforts undertaken in partnership.
            vision_contents_p4: |
                La UE se comprometió a aumentar los presupuestos dedicados a la ayuda hasta alcanzar 
                el 0,7 % del producto interior bruto (PNB) de aquí a 2015, con un objetivo colectivo 
                intermedio del 0,56 % de aquí a 2010; la mitad de este incremento de la ayuda se destinará a 
                África. Se seguirá dando prioridad al apoyo a los países menos adelantados, los de rentabilidad 
                baja e intermedia. Los recursos se asignarán de manera objetiva y 
                transparente, en función de las necesidades y de los resultados. El principio de concentración 
                orientará la programación de la Comunidad por países y regiones, lo que implicará 
                seleccionar un número limitado de ámbitos prioritarios en vez de dispersar los esfuerzos en 
                sectores excesivamente numerosos.
            vision_contents_p5: |
                The EU will promote better coordination and complementarity between donors by working
                towards joint multi-annual programming based on partner country strategies and
                processes, common implementation mechanisms, joint missions involving more than one
                donor, and the use of co-financing arrangements. It will also foster consistency in development
                policy in a wide variety of areas, especially trade, security and migration, in order to
                meet the Millennium Development Goals.
            policy: The European Community development policy
            policy_contents_p1: |
                Community policy in this field must complement the policies of the Member States. Its
                added value comes from its presence worldwide, its expertise in dispensing aid, its role
                in promoting consistency between policies and best practice and in facilitating coordination
                and harmonisation, its support for democracy, human rights, good governance and
                respect for international law, and its role in promoting participation in civil society and
                North-South solidarity.
            policy_contents_p2: |
                The Community will use the most efficient instruments available: it will favour a differentiated
                approach based on needs, priorities and the strengths of the countries concerned.
                Development cooperation is a major component of a broader set of external measures
                which must be consistent and complementary. The programming documents - country,
                regional and thematic strategy papers - reflect this range of policies and ensure consistency between them.
            policy_contents_p3: |
                To meet the needs stated by partner countries, the Community will concentrate its activities
                in the following areas: trade and regional integration; the environment and the
                sustainable management of natural resources; infrastructure, communications and transport;
                water and energy; rural development, territorial planning, agriculture and food security;
                governance, democracy, human rights and support for economic and institutional
                reforms; prevention of conflicts and of state fragility; human development; and social cohesion and employment.
            policy_contents_p4: |
                The Community will strengthen mainstreaming in relation to certain issues involving general
                principles applicable to any initiative and which call for efforts in several sectors: democracy;
                good governance; human rights; the rights of children and indigenous peoples;
                gender equality; environmental sustainability; and the fight against HIV/AIDS.
            policy_contents_p5: |
                The type of aid provided will be tailored to the needs and context of each individual country.
                Where conditions allow, budget aid will be the preferred type. The Community will
                use an approach based on results and performance indicators. Most Community aid will
                continue to be provided in the form of grants, an approach which is particularly suitable
                for the poorest countries and for those with a limited ability to repay.

                Harmonisation and Alignment (H&amp;A) is high on the agenda in Nicaragua as EU Donors increasingly focus on issues related to aid coordination and the fulfilment of global commitments
                enshrined in the Millennium Development Goals, the Paris Declaration and the European Consensus on Development which all highlight the need for greater aid effectiveness
                in order to eradicate extreme poverty in developing countries and improve the overall impact of Official Development Assistance (ODA).
            overview_p2: |
                In Nicaragua, aid coordination is a highly complex and formidable task given the large number of donors (reportedly over 40) and the high volume of ODA per annum (approx 563 Million USD in 2007) not to mention the second lowest development indicators in the region and a changing political and economic landscape which present considerable challenges
                for the success potential of any H&amp;A initiative. Nicaragua continues to be a priority country for most EU donors and is highly dependent upon on development cooperation which represents roughly 11% of GDP and 75% of its Public Investment Plan (PIP).
            overview_p3: |
                Together with the European Commission there are currently 11 EU Member States operating
                in Nicaragua; this combined force is the main net ODA contributor to Nicaragua and therefore any EU-led coordination initiative has the potential to impact substantially on the local aid environment. EU donors are working closely among themselves, with non-EU donors and with the Government of Nicaragua in order to define strategic priorities for H&amp;A and specific, tangible and measurable actions which will lead to short, medium and long term improvements.
            progress: Progress in the period 2002-2007
            progress_contents: |
                In the period 2002-2007 Nicaragua has been highly active as an OECD/DAC and EU pilot country for H&amp;A initiatives and has succeeded in implementing several measures including
                the following:
            roadmap: 'H&amp;A Roadmap: Nicaraguan National Action Plan for H&amp;A 2005-2007'
            roadmap_contents_p1: |
                The Nicaragua National Action Plan for H&amp;A, adopted in November 2005 identifies objectives,
                specific actions, expected results, related indicators of achievement and deadlines for completion on a short, medium and long term level in relation to ownership, harmonisation
                and alignment, results-based management and mutual accountability.
            roadmap_contents_p2: |
                The plan fully incorporates the 12 Paris Indicators and represents an important in-country process. A multi-stakeholder H&amp;A monitoring group including EU members has been established
                in order to promote implementation of the Plan and to provide regular feedback on advances to date.
            enhanced_coordination: 'Enhanced Coordination: Sector roundtables in priority areas'
            enhanced_coordination_contents: |
                The Nicaraguan Presidential Agreement of February 71-2003 called for the establishment
                of sector roundtables in order to enhance the coordination of external aid. These roundtables
                aim to improve communication and information exchange between Government and donors in the priority areas of Education, Governance, Health, Infrastructure, Production, and Social Protection. EU Donors are present in all these fora and are actively contributing towards the development of Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps) where appropriate; such SWAps contain multi-annual action plans and expenditure forecasts allowing government and donors to better plan activities and financial disbursements with a medium to long-term perspective. Several roundtables have succeeded in signing Codes of Conduct and Memoranda of Understanding in order to improve coordination and better support approved
                sector strategies and common funding arrangements.
            dialogue_mechanisms: 'Improved Dialogue Mechanisms: Global Donor/Government roundtable and Donor Quintet'
            dialogue_mechanisms_contents: |
                High-level Global Donor/Government meetings are held each semester in order to discuss and exchange views on national priorities. 
                The Government presents its perspective on progress to date and future orientations and similarly the donor community expresses 
                its opinions and raises concerns on priority issues. In order to coordinate better the opinions of donors, in February 2006 
                the international donor community decided to elect a high-level Steering Group, the Quintet which facilitates discussions 
                on national priorities and prepares common donors positions. This group meets quarterly with the 
                Government’s Inter-Institutional Commission, and currently comprises the European Commission and Finland together with non-EU donors, 
                Japan, Canada and IADB/WB.
            budget_support: 'Budget Support; joint arrangements'
            budget_support_contents: |
                In 2005, the Government of Nicaragua and a consortium of nine donors including six EU donors (the European Commission, Germany, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) signed a Joint Financing Arrangement (JFA) in order to contribute with budget support towards the fulfilment of the Nicaraguan Poverty Reduction Strategy
                2005-2009. Through the JFA, both the Government and the Donors have committed themselves to common procedures for policy dialogue, commitments and disbursements, auditing and reporting, monitoring and evaluation, and information exchange. The increased
                use of budget support is expected to improve co-ordination and harmonisation among donors involved, to encourage greater alignment, lower transaction costs, greater predictability of funding and higher efficiency in the allocation of public expenditure.
            challenges: 'H&amp;A Challenges for 2008'
            challenges_contents: |
                With the installation of the New Government for Reconciliation and National Unity in January 2007, 
                there has been the obvious need to jointly review H&A activities in order to ensure that they adequately reflect the 
                national priorities in the new Human National Development Plan for Nicaragua. Challenges for 2008 include:
            consolidating_progress: 'Consolidating progress; reinforced dialogue and sound country ownership'
            consolidating_progress_contents: |
                EU donors, the government and relevant development partners have a duty to build on the progress made in the period 2002-2007. There is a need to reinforce and verify the suitability of existing dialogue mechanisms and to encourage frank and transparent dialogue
                at both technical and political levels. The incumbent Government has shown strong leadership and this needs to be accompanied by a coordinated response from donors.
            establishment: Establishment of a new Nicaragua National Action Plan for Harmonisation, Alignment and Ownership 2008-2010
            establishment_contents: |
                Both donors and government have underlined the need to establish a new Action plan for the period 2008-2010 which will place emphasis on the 3 main axes of harmonisation, alignment and country ownership. The previous plan 2005-2007 has been assessed and a Government/Donor workshop was organised in February 2008 to reflect on the achievements
                and to identify where progress was needed and where impediments to greater H&amp;A still remain.
            code_of_conduct: EU Code of Conduct; greater complementarity and division of labour
            code_of_conduct_contents: |
                EU donors are rising to the challenge of implementing the EU Code of Conduct (CoC) adopted in May 07. 
                As a preparatory step, an analysis of where each EU donor stands in relation to each of the Code’s Guiding Principles was undertaken in the period November 07 – February 08. Preliminary results indicate that already much progress has been made but that more innovative efforts are needed. Some EU donors are present in more than 3 priority areas, EU donors do not always have a clear and common vision of how to proceed in relation to the division of labour, many have unsynchronised programming, budgeting and disbursement cycles. 
                A CoC Action Plan will be drawn up for the period 2008-2009 and the EU’s fulfilment of the Code will be carefully monitored.
