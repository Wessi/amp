# Aid Management Platform Deployer

It can be use on any OS for local development. But it's limited to Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL, Centos or Scientific) for
staging, preprod, production and other environments.

> TODO: Split the Ansible scripts into 2 groups: one for setting the OS and one ore setting individual environments.


## OS Setup Instructions


### Deploying using Vagrant for local development environments

0.  Please see the **happy-deployer** requirements and setup instructions: https://github.com/devgateway/happy-deployer

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```
    mkdir -p /workspace/amp212/
    cd /workspace/amp212/
    svn checkout https://svn.dgfoundation.org/amp/branches/AMP_2_12_RELEASE/ .
    ```
    NOTE:
    > *   You can provide `--username xxx` if your current user name is not the same as the SVN user.

2.  Build the VM and install all required software:
    ```
    cd /workspace/amp212/amp-deployer/
    vagrant up --provision
    ```
    NOTES:
    > *   This might take a while! You can add `time` before the command name to see the execution time, it should take
        about 13 minutes.
        ```
        time vagrant up --provision
        ```

    > *   Ignore this message, it just means your computer is slow :p
        ```
        default: Error: Remote connection disconnect. Retrying...
        ```

4.  Make sure that your `/etc/hosts` file has been updated and contains the following entries:
    ```
    10.10.10.212  amp.local  # VAGRANT: ...
    ```

5.  You can now SSH into the VM:
    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```
    NOTE:
    > *   On windows you can run `vagrant ssh-config` to view the information required for
          [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).

5.  See the "Environment Setup Instructions" sections for how to the setup AMP or/and CMS (Public Portal) environments.


### Deploying directly on the OS for testing or production environments


1.  Clone the repo:
    ```
    mkdir -p /opt/devgateway/amp212/
    cd /opt/devgateway/amp212/
    svn checkout https://svn.dgfoundation.org/amp/branches/AMP_2_12_RELEASE/ .
    ```
    NOTE:
    > *   You can provide `--username xxx` if your current user name is not the same as the SVN user.

2.  Install and configure ansible:
    ```
    make bootstrap-el7
    ```

3.  Prepare a set of variables for the environment
    ```
    # Create an environment file
    cp DeployerSettings.yml DeployerSettings.TLS-staging.yml
    # or
    cp DeployerSettings.yml DeployerSettings.MDA-preprod.yml

    # Then update the files to add new DBs, VirtualHosts and so on...
    ```

4.  Provision the environment:
    ```
    make provision ENVIRONMENT=TLS-staging
    # or
    make provision ENVIRONMENT=MDA-preprod
    ```

5.  See the "Environment Setup Instructions" sections for how to the setup AMP or/and CMS (Public Portal) environments.


## Environment Setup Instructions


### AMP Environment Setup Instructions:

1.  Once inside the VM, run to go into the project folder:
    ```
    cd /opt/devgateway/amp212-local/
    ```

2.  Import a database:
    ```
    # If the backup was made using the amp backup scripts in PGSQL format.
    pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-owner --no-privileges --username amp_user --dbname amp_local amp.pgsql
    # or
    zcat amp.pgsql.gz | pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-owner --no-privileges --username amp_user --dbname amp_local
    ```

3.  Prepare the database:
    ```
    psql --username amp_user --dbname amp_local

    # Prepare the DB for the local environment:
    # TODO: Add instructions on how to generate a new password.
    => UPDATE dg_site_domain SET site_domain='amp212.local';
    => UPDATE dg_user SET password='a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d';
    => UPDATE amp_global_settings SET settingsvalue = 'false' WHERE settingsname = 'Secure Server';
    ```

3.  Build the environment:
    ```
    # TODO: Improve the script to accept DB credentials via a settings file or CLI.
    amp-build
    ```
    NOTE: This might take a while! You can add `time` before the command name to see the execution time, it should take
          about 14 minutes the first time and 5m after that.

4.  Restart tomcat:
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart tomcat7.service
    ```

4.  Check if the project has been installed properly, go to: [amp212.local/login](http://amp212.local/login)
    NOTE: The domain root redirects to `/portal`.


### CMS Environment Setup Instructions:

1.  Go to the project folder:
    ```
    # For Vagrant environments:
    cd /var/www/amp212-cms-local/
    ```

2.  Prepare drupal for installation, run these inside the VM in the project folder:
    *   Prepare the environment by running one of the following commands for your environment:
        ```
        # Prepare environment for local development.
        make prepare-local

        # Prepare environment for staging.
        make prepare-staging

        # Prepare environment for preprod.
        make prepare-preprod

        # Prepare environment for production.
        make prepare-production
        ```
        NOTE:
        > *   For staging, preprod and production environments you will need to update the database credentials in
              `settings.custom.php`.

    *   Check the database connection settings of the project:
        ```
        drush sqlc
        ```
        You should see the DB prompt with the project database selected. To quit, just execute `\q`.

    *   For local development environments copy the sample update script:
        ```
        cp sites/default/update_scripts/environment/setup.local{_sample,}.php
        ```

3.  Install or import an Environment:
    *   If you want a new and clean `amp-cms` installation run:
        ```
        make install
        ```
        NOTE: This might take a while! You can add `time` before the command name to see the execution time, it should
              take about 3 minutes.

    *   Alternatively, **IF** you have a database dump, you can import it using:
        ```
        # If the backup was made using `drush dump`:
        zcat DUMP.sql.gz | drush sqlc

        # If the backup was made using the amp backup scripts in PGSQL format.
        pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-owner --no-privileges --username amp_cms_user --dbname amp_cms_local amp-cms.pgsql
        # or
        zcat amp-cms.pgsql.gz | pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-owner --no-privileges --username amp_cms_user --dbname amp_cms_local

        # Make sure to update the project settings for the current environment.
        make update

        # You can generate a one-time-login link for the main Drupal use and you can change the password from the UI:
        drush user-login
        # or you can change the password from the CLI by running:
        drush user-password oneUser
        ```
        NOTE:
        > *   Update the DB information if you are not using the default development settings.

4.  Check if the project has been installed properly, go to: [amp212.local/portal](http://amp212.local/portal)
